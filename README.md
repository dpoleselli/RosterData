# Roster Generation

This Python program scrapes the GSAC baseball website for Roster Data.

## Description

Playing for Westmont Baseball in the GSAC, I built this program to help generate rosters for our opponents. It uses 
Beautiful Soup to scrape data from the GSAC webpage that provides roster data for each team.  
This program was designed to serve as an input for [In-Game Edge](http://ingameedge.com/) which is a real-time baseball
analytics web app. It is currently still in development, so for more information, please reach out to me directly.
